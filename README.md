## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Understand cultural patterns in Indian cuisine through data
- **Dataset:** Indian Food 101 — 255 dishes with details on ingredients, region, course, and timing
- **Tools Used:** 
  - Python (EDA & Cleaning)
  - Power BI (Dashboard & Visual Analytics)

---

## 🌍 Key Insights Visualized

- Over 80% of dishes are vegetarian
- Snack and main course dishes dominate the dataset
- North India leads in variety of regional dishes
- Spicy is the most common flavor profile
- Most dishes are cooked in under 30 minutes

---

## ⚙️ Features of the Dashboard

- Interactive filters by **region**, **diet**, and **course**
- Clean KPI cards showing average prep/cook time, dish variety, and ingredient diversity
- Charts exploring:
  - Diet vs Dish Type
  - Course & Flavor Distribution
  - Region & State-level variety
  - Cooking Time Patterns

## 🧪 How It Was Built

1. **EDA in Python (Jupyter Notebook)**:
   - Data preview, type correction, handling `-1` values
   - Null value treatment and categorical insights
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Replaced invalid numeric/text values
   - Exported cleaned `.csv` to load into Power BI
3. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Responsive slicers, customized themes, cards, and layered visuals
